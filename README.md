# Udacity-Continuous-Control


### Project Details

### Getting Started

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

   - __Linux__ or __Mac__: 

   ```bash
   conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
   source activate drlnd
   ```

   - __Windows__: 

   ```bash
   conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
   activate drlnd
   ```

2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuhouzhou/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
   cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
   pip install .
   ```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
   ```

4. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.

5. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

   - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
   - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
   - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
   - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

   (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

   (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

6. Place the files in this repo in the `p1_navigation/` folder. 

7. After above steps you are ready to run the `p1_navigation/Navigation.ipynb`
